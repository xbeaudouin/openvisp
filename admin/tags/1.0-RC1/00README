OpenVISP Admin 00README
-----------------------

OpenVISP Admin is a fork of Postfix Admin before the License change.

What will do OpenVISP Admin :

- Unique way to log into the webinterface: no more needs to 
  have a .htpasswd like in Postfix Admin
- Have Web hosting feature
- Have Amavisd-new integration
- ... 

Installation :

You need to have a webserver with PHP support (Apache, or whatever).

PHP needs support for :
  - MySQL 5.0 or later (mysql or mysqli)
  - session
  - pcre
  - snmp if you will use "datacenter" part
  - posix 
  - sockets to communicate with amavisd-new
  - gd for captcha stuff 
  - pear-Net-IMAP for IMAP filter editions
  - pear-MDB2 and your locate database MDB2 Driver


Point your webserver to /where/is/located/this/file/htdocs/ like for this
example (Apache)

Alias /admin/ /where/is/located/this/file/htdocs/

You will need to setup a MySQL database (Postgres SQL is more or less 
supported,the code is here, but SQL schema is not updated or tested).

Use file doc/DATABASE.TXT to populate the database. Check permissions for
getting acces to this database from PHP and webserver.

Copy config.inc.php.sample into config.inc.php and update and modify it
to your needs.

Point your favorite browser to http://host/admin/setup.php and look around
the setup process.

When finished *DON'T FORGET* to *REMOVE* this file. Or you'll get some security
problems !!

Then go to http://host/admin/ and login with the default user and passord :

login : admin@ova.local
pass  : admin

Don't forget to create one user for you and *delete* this temporaly user.
