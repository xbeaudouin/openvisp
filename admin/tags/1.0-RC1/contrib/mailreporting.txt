Mail Reporting is a third party program that make some mail report
to user of the content of their quarantine.

if a mail is recognized as a spam but for the end-user this is ham,
he loose this mail. If the policy is to deliver the email, the user 
will not be annoyed by this problem, but if the policy is to put it
in quarantine, the user will not be able to release it with out
a web interface or the help of a mailadmin.

So the goal is to have good policy to put spam in quarantine, and
to inform the enduser every x hour (4hours is IMHO the best) a report
of what his quarantine look like.
so add the mailreport.php to your crontab.

2 options are offered.
the first is to release it, so the mail will be delivered in the 20 seconds.

the second and last is to delete it.

To make it working, we'll need a php page to be available to everybody.
This page (mailaction.php) will receive some parameters (mailid and releaseid);



In all case the mail in quarantine, will be marked to be deleted of
the disk in the database.

A 3rd program of cleaning process should be written to clean the spool
quarantine release or delete spam every day or week as the  admin like. 


PS : At this time the 2 php program don't have any central parameters.
I don't know if we could split some part in different servers. 

Don't forget to change this values to what you need :
##WEBSERVER##
##MAILDOMAIN##
