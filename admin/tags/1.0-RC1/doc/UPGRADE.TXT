REQUIRED!!
----------
- You are using Postfix 2.0 or higher.
- You are using Apache 1.3.27 or higher.
- You are using PHP 4.1 or higher (PHP 5.x or higher is not supported yet).
- You are using MySQL 3.23.xx or higher. (MySQL 4.1.xx or higher is not supported yet).


READ THIS FIRST!
----------------
It's recommened that you install Postfix Admin in a new folder and not
on-top of the old install!!

When you are upgrading from Postfix Admin 1.5x (or older), make sure you
backup your database before you run the TABLE_CHANGES.TXT on your database.

When you are upgrading from Postfix Admin 2.0.x, please read the BACKUP_MX.TXT.


1. Backup the Database
----------------------
When you install from a previous version make sure you backup your database
first. There are a lot of changes in the database structure since Postfix Admin
1.5.4.

  $ mysqldump -a -u root -p > /tmp/postfixadmin-backup.sql


2. Unarchive new Postfix Admin
------------------------------
Make sure that you are in your WWW directory and then unarchive the
Postfix Admin archive (whatever the filename is):

  $ tar -zxvf postfixadmin-2.0.0.tgz


3. Change permissions
----------------------
Since the database  password is stored in the config.inc.php it's a good idea
to have Postfix Admin set to the permission of the webserver. In this
example, we assume that user "www" and group "www" are the web server as is
often the case with Apache.

  $ cd /usr/local/www
  $ chown -R www:www postfixadmin-2.0.0

This is also a good idea for the file permissions.

  $ cd /usr/local/www/postfixadmin-2.0.0
  $ chmod 640 *.php *.css
  $ cd /usr/local/www/postfixadmin-2.0.0/admin/
  $ chmod 640 *.php .ht*
  $ cd /usr/local/www/postfixadmin-2.0.0/images/
  $ chmod 640 *.gif *.png
  $ cd /usr/local/www/postfixadmin-2.0.0/languages/
  $ chmod 640 *.lang
  $ cd /usr/local/www/postfixadmin-2.0.0/templates/
  $ chmod 640 *.tpl
  $ cd /usr/local/www/postfixadmin-2.0.0/users/
  $ chmod 640 *.php
  
Additionally, if "chown user:group" doesn't work, you can use "chown user"
and "chgrp group" instead. See the man pages for these commands for more
information.


4. Modify the MySQL Tables
--------------------------
In TABLE_CHANGES.TXT or TABLE_BACKUP_MX.TXT you can find the table structure that you need in order
to configure Postfix Admin 2.0.0 and Postfix in general to work with Virtual
Domains and Users


5. Configure
------------
Check the config.inc.php file. There you can specify settings that are
relevant to your setup.


6. Done
-------
This is all that is needed. Fire up your browser and go to the site that you
specified to host Postfix Admin.
