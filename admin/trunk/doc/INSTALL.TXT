REQUIRED!!
----------
- You are using Postfix 2.0 or higher.
- You are using Apache 1.3.27 or higher.
- You are using PHP 4.1 or higher.
- You are using MySQL 3.23.xx or higher.


READ THIS FIRST!
----------------
When this is an upgrade from Postfix Admin please read UPGRADE.TXT!!


1. Unarchive new OpenVISP Admin
-------------------------------
Make sure that you are in your WWW directory and then unarchive the
Postfix Admin archive (whatever the filename is):

  $ tar -zxvf openvisp-admin-1.0.0.tgz


2. Change permissions
----------------------
Since the database  password is stored in the config.inc.php it's a good idea
to have OpenVISP Admin set to the permission of the webserver. In this
example, we assume that user "www" and group "www" are the web server as is
often the case with Apache.

  $ cd /usr/local/www
  $ chown -R www:www openvisp-admin-2.0.0
  $ chmod 775 openvisp-admin-2.0.0/logos

Additionally, if "chown user:group" doesn't work, you can use "chown user"
and "chgrp group" instead. See the man pages for these commands for more
information.


3. Create the MySQL Tables
--------------------------
In MYSQL-ADDRIGHTS.TCT you can find the lines to add for adding rights or
priviledges for OpenVISP Admin

In DATABASE.TXT you can find the table structure that you need in order to
configure OpenVISP Admin and Postfix in general to work with Virtual Domains
and Users

If you wish to manage mysql database and user (create, drop) in OVA, you will
need to configure the $CONF['mysql_db_*'] part in config.inc.php
with the a user with this options in mysql:

// CREATE USER 'littleadmin'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'littleadmin';
// GRANT SELECT , CREATE , DROP , RELOAD , SHOW DATABASES , CREATE USER ON * . * TO 'littleadmin'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION MAX_QUERIES_PER_HOUR 0 MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_HOUR 0 MAX_UPDATES_PER_HOUR 0 MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 0 ;
// GRANT SELECT , INSERT , UPDATE , DELETE ON `mysql`.`db` TO 'pseudoadmin'@'%';
// GRANT SELECT , INSERT , UPDATE , DELETE ON `mysql`.`user` TO 'pseudoadmin'@'%';
// FLUSH PRIVILEGES ;


4. Configure
------------
Load you favorite brownser and point it to the place where you have installed
OpenVISP Admin. In general it is located on http://localhost:80/admin/.

You should be redirected to http://localhost:80/admin/setup.php if you don't 
have a config.inc.php file. If not, please load manualy setup.php on your
browser.

The installation guide will check your system and the availability of some
PHP extensions. Please install if it is asked for.

Copy the config.inc.php.sample to config.inc.php and edit it to specify 
setting that are relevant to your setup when setup.exe will ask for such work.

Notice that Encryption scheme WILL BE used to crypt the default password and
admin user. There IS NO WAY to change scheme when the database is populated 
(with the exception that clear password *can* be changed into system or md5, but
there is no script that does that automaticaly).

When you have finished the setup.php, you will have a default full user :

Login    : admin@foo.com
Password : admin

Please login into OpenVISP and CHANGE this password to a new value.


5. Post Configuration
---------------------
Please DON'T FORGET to remove the file setup.php because it can give you
a BIG HOLE in your system espacialy if you remove admin@foo.com administrator
and the default domain : foo.com.

You have been warned for that now.


6. Done
-------
This is all that is needed. Fire up your browser and go to the site that you
specified to host OpenVISP Admin.


7. More information
-------------------
For more information you can go to the OpenVISP Admin mailing lists.
