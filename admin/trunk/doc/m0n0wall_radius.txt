Radius Attributes for m0n0wall pptp access :

Quickest for getting it to work:

1) Edit clients.conf and add an entry for your NAS (the m0n0-box)
2) Edit users and include:

testuser Auth-Type := MS-CHAP, Password == thisisatest
        Service-Type = Framed-User,
        Framed-Protocol = PPP,
        Framed-IP-Address = 192.168.11.22,
        Framed-IP-Netmask = 255.255.255.240,
        Framed-Routing = Broadcast-Listen,
        Framed-Filter-Id = "std.ppp",
        Framed-MTU = 1500,
        Framed-Compression = Van-Jacobsen-TCP-IP
3) configure m0n0-box
4) configure freeradius and move towards pam/ldap/oracle setup (probably in that order ;-)
     - adding reasonable DEFAULT entry with something like:
       Framed-IP-Address = 192.168.11.16+,
       Framed-IP-Netmask = 255.255.255.240,
     could help if you want to keep it simple and use system auth.

That's it from me, there are people who know better ...
