REQUIRED!
---------
You need to have the following installed to be able to use Virtual Vacation.
- Perl5
- Perl DBI


About Virtual Vacation
----------------------
Virual Vacation is today done with a local shell account that can receive
email. The email is then handled by a Perl script which sends the Vacation
message back to the sender.


Install Virtual Vacation
------------------------


1. Create a local account
-------------------------
Create a dedicated local user account called "vacation". 
This user handles all potentially dangerous mail content - that is why it
should be a separate account.

Do not use "nobody", and most certainly do not use "root" or "postfix".  The
user will never log in, and can be given a "*" password and non-existent
shell and home directory.

This should look like this:

#/etc/passwd
vacation:*:65501:65501::0:0:Virtual Vacation:/nonexistent:/sbin/nologin


2. Create a directory
---------------------
Create a directory, for example  /var/spool/vacation, that is accessible
only to the "vacation" user. This is where the content filtering script is
supposed to store its temporary files.


3. Define the filter
--------------------
Define the content filter in the Postfix master file:

#/etc/postfix/master.cf:
filter    unix  -       n       n       -       -       pipe
  flags=Rq user=filter argv=/somewhere/filter -f ${sender} -- ${recipient}

To turn on content filtering for mail arriving via SMTP only, append
"-o content_filter=filter:dummy" to the master.cf entry that defines
the Postfix SMTP server:

#/etc/postfix/master.cf:
smtp      inet     ...stuff...      smtpd
  -o content_filter=filter:dummy

The content_filter configuration parameter accepts the same syntax as the
right-hand side in a Postfix transport table.

Execute "postfix reload" to complete the change.

For more information on filtering in Postfix read the FILTER_README.

4. Copy the files
-----------------
 
  $ cp mail-filter <HOME>/mail-filter
  $ cp vacation.pl <HOME>/vacation.pl
  $ chown -R vacation:nogroup <HOME>

Which will then look something like:

-rwx------   1 vacation  nogroup   409 Dec 21 00:00 mail-filter*
-rwx------   1 vacation  nogroup  3356 Dec 21 00:00 vacation.pl*


5. Create the table
-------------------

To use Virtual Vacation with Postfix Admin you need to create an extra table
in the database that is used by Postfix Admin.

USE postfix;
#
# Table structure for table vacation
#
CREATE TABLE vacation (
  email varchar(255) NOT NULL default '',
  subject varchar(255) NOT NULL default '',
  body text NOT NULL,
  cache text NOT NULL,
  domain varchar(255) NOT NULL default '',
  created datetime NOT NULL default '0000-00-00 00:00:00',
  active tinyint(4) NOT NULL default '1',
  PRIMARY KEY  (email),
  KEY email (email)
) TYPE=MyISAM COMMENT='Postfix Admin - Virtual Vacation';


What do these files do?
-----------------------
mail-filter picks up every single email and pushes it towards the
vacation.pl

vacation.pl then checks the database to see wether a user is on holiday and
what message to send back. Make sure that vacation.pl is able to communicate
to your databse. In the first couple of lines you have to specify the
database, username and password for it.
NOTE: Make sure that the path to perl is correct.


I'm in trouble!
---------------
When something is not working there are a couple of files that you can have
a look at. The most important one is your maillog (usually in /var/log/).

Vacation.pl also has some debugging and logging capabilties. Check the top
of vacation.pl.


Done!
-----
When this is all in place you need to have a look at the Postfix Admin
config.inc.php. Here you need to enable Virtual Vacation for the site.
