Datacenter utilities scripts
----------------------------

o ova-target.pl
  This script add remove to the DB the targets from MRTG files 
  used by routers2.cgi.

  You have to edit this script and modify the line 10 according to
  your system configuration of routers2.cgi in case of non standard
  configuration of your machine.

  Per default the script will have a look for routers2.conf file in
  the following directories :

  /etc
  /usr/local/etc
  /opt/etc

  Starting with line 11 you have SQL database configuration (currently
  tested and working with MySQL with DBI / DBD::mysql) to allow update
  into the DB of the values. 

  You should execute this script everytime you modifiy the 
  mrtg configuration files.

  You can execute this in a crontab, but avoid doing this to often
  because it may load your SQL database with dummy request (on per
  target in mrtg file... so be aware !!!).
