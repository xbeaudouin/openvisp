Since mod_vhs 1.0.12 B1
-----------------------

o Added options on load that mod_vhs wait for input from mod_alias and
  mod_userdir before mod_vhs make things works.
o Added options on load that mod_vhs is making his work before mod_rewrite
  and mod_php is making their works.
o Added option vhs_Default_Host_Redirect (on/off) to force HTTP redirect
  if default host is triggered.
o The module should be now threads safe. Note that we don't garantee
  that your Apache will still be thread safe if you use non thread
  safe module (like mod_php for example).
o Add support for PHP 4.3.x. The following entries are modified according
  to <VirtualHost></> httpd.conf.
  Example :

   <VirtualHost 1.2.3.4>
   vhs_Default_Host www.mydomain.com
   vhs_PHPsafe_mode On
   vhs_PHPopen_basedir On
   </VirtualHost>


   <VirtualHost 1.2.3.5>
   vhs_Default_Host www.mydomain.com
   vhs_PHPsafe_mode Off
   vhs_PHPopen_basedir Off
   </VirtualHost>
  
  Option from Koen de Boeve
