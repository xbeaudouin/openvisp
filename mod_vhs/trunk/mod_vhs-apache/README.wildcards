mod_vhs doesn't support wildcard because libhome does it very well so there
is no need to add duplicate code in this module.

Here is some line to add under [mod_vhs] statments :

fallback ^(.*)\.(.*)\.(.*)$  $2.$3

This will support things like *.stuff.com if you have stuff.com in your 
database/ldap sources.
