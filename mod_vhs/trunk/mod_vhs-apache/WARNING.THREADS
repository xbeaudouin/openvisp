Warning about threaded PHP
--------------------------

This software has been tested and developped ONLY on prefork apache 2.

I have added mutex against libhome accesses. So this module _should_ be
thread safe. Anyway I don't have to opportunity to test mod_vhs and
apache2 in NPM=worker. So please submit bugs reports and patches to
mod_vhs@lists.oav.net.

Thanks for you attention.
