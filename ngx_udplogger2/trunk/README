Two differences from the original work:
- the default for udplog is off.
- access_udplog takes an optional 3rd argument "bare":
      access_udplog 1.1.1.1:100 loghost bare;

If bare is specified, the message is sent exactly as specified in the logformat directive without any change.
This can be used for udp logging to non-syslog hosts.
