# Policy Daemon aka OpenVISP Policyd (OVP) 
############################################

  Policyd is an anti-spam plugin for Postfix (written in C) that
  does Greylisting, Sender-(envelope,  SASL or  host / ip)-based
  throttling (on messages and/or volume per  defined time unit),
  Spamtrap monitoring / blacklisting, helo auto blacklisting and
  helo randomization prevention (HRP).



###
# Greylisting
###############

  Greylisting   is a  concept that originated  from  Evan Harris
  which is described in  better detail at http://greylisting.org
  Greylisting is a new method of blocking significant amounts of
  spam at  the mail server level, but without resorting to heavy
  weight statistical  analysis  or  other  heuristic (and  error 
  prone)  approaches.  Consequently,  implementations are fairly
  lightweight,   and  may  even   decrease  network  traffic and
  processor load on your mail server.

  Greylisting  relies on the fact that most  spam sources do not
  behave  in the same way as "normal"  mail systems. Although it
  is currently very effective by itself,  it will  perform  best
  when  it  is  used  in  conjunction  with  other forms of spam
  prevention. 



###
# Sender Throttling 
#####################

  Sender throttling module allows quota enforcement.  Currently
  you may throttle based on amount of mails and total mail size
  sent over a given period of time which you define.

  Eg: You  can enforce that camis@mweb.co.za does not send more
  than 1000 mails or 1gig of mail (whichever limit is hit first)
  in say a 5 minute  period.
  
  There are 3 possible sender throttling methods:

-> 1) Throttle by (envelope) From address

INSERT INTO throttle \
 (_from,_count_max,_quota_max,_time_limit,_mail_size,_date,_priority)
 VALUES ('user@domain.com',  # from address                             
          50,                # maximum messages per time unit
          250000000,         # size in bytes (250 megs) (maximum is 2gig)
          86400,             # time unit in seconds (1 day)
          10240000,          # maximum message size (10 meg)
          UNIX_TIMESTAMP(),  # current time
          10);               # priority of record

  OR domain:

INSERT INTO throttle \
 (_from,_count_max,_quota_max,_time_limit,_mail_size,_date,_priority)
 VALUES ('@domain.com',      # domain                                   
          50,                # maximum messages per time unit
          250000000,         # size in bytes (250 megs) (maximum is 2gig)
          86400,             # time unit in seconds (1 day)
          10240000,          # maximum message size (10 meg)
          UNIX_TIMESTAMP(),  # current time
          5);                # priority of record

  Do take note of the "priority" record as this allows you to have
  global limits for a specific domain, but if there are specific
  accounts that need their own dedicated/specific/unique limit then
  you can add their records but with a higher priority.

-> 2) Throttle by SASL user name

INSERT INTO throttle
(_from,_count_max,_quota_max,_time_limit,_mail_size,_date)
 VALUES ('SASL_username',    # from address, SASL username or ip address
          50,                # maximum messages per time unit
          250000000,         # size in bytes (250 megs)
          86400,             # time unit in seconds (1 day)
          10240000,          # maximum message size (10 meg)
          UNIX_TIMESTAMP()); # current time

-> 3) Throttle by IP address

INSERT INTO throttle \
 (_from,_count_max,_quota_max,_time_limit,_mail_size,_date,_priority)
 VALUES ('192.168.0.1',      # from address                             
          50,                # maximum messages per time unit
          250000000,         # size in bytes (250 megs) (maximum is 2gig)
          86400,             # time unit in seconds (1 day)
          10240000,          # maximum message size (10 meg)
          UNIX_TIMESTAMP(),  # current time
          10);               # priority of record

  OR netblock:

INSERT INTO throttle \
 (_from,_count_max,_quota_max,_time_limit,_mail_size,_date,_priority)
 VALUES ('192.168.0.%',      # domain                                   
          50,                # maximum messages per time unit
          250000000,         # size in bytes (250 megs) (maximum is 2gig)
          86400,             # time unit in seconds (1 day)
          10240000,          # maximum message size (10 meg)
          UNIX_TIMESTAMP(),  # current time
          5);                # priority of record

  Upon the first time a sender sends a mail through the sender
  throttling module, if they do not exist in the database, the
  module will grab the configuration defaults from policyd.conf
  and those values will be inserted into the database. You can
  at a later stage (if you wish) increase those limits by changing
  the values in MySQL. If you wish to create users immediately
  with higher values, you can do the following:

  If you enable throttling by SASL and a client connects to
  Postfix without SASL info, by default Policyd will automatically
  use the MAIL FROM: address so nothing breaks.

  To keep the database compact and remove inactive entries, you can
  set a time limit for automatic cleanup.


  
###
#  Recipient Throttling 
#########################

  Recipient Throttling module allows quota enforcement. An example
  of where this module is useful are if people maintain SMS gateways
  and have requirements that SMS abuse does not occur. Also this is
  useful on outgoing smtp/relays during virus outbreaks. Recent
  virus outbreaks had a few infected machines flooding the same
  recipients over and over. 
 
  You can enforce that no user receives more than 1000 mails in a
  given time period.

  Upon the first delivery a recipient receives, if they do not exist
  in the database, the module will grab the configuration defaults
  from policyd.conf and those values will be inserted into the 
  database. You can at a later stage (if you wish) increase those
  limits by changing the values in MySQL. If you want to create
  users immediately with high values, you can do the following:

INSERT INTO throttle_rcpt (_rcpt,_count_max,_time_limit,_date)
 VALUES ('camis@mweb.co.za', # recipient address
          100,               # maximum messages per time unit
          86400,             # time unit in seconds (1 day)
          UNIX_TIMESTAMP()); # current time


  To keep the database compact and remove inactive entries, you can
  set a time limit for automatic cleanup.



##
# Spamtrap
############

  The spamtrap module should be very effective, especially in
  really large environments. Previously baited spamtraps would
  require that the mail actually enters the network and gets
  delivered into a mailbox. Any attempted deliveries to any of
  the spamtrap addresses will cause that host/net block to be
  blacklisted for N amount of hours. Using the spamtrap module
  the host gets blacklisted without having to accept or transfer
  any mail so resources are kept to a minimum.

  Spamtrap format:
  
    INSERT INTO spamtrap (_rcpt,_active) VALUES ('spam@trap.com', 1);
  
  1=active
  0=inactive (strictly for production purposes/testing) 



##
# Blacklist Helo
#################

  The blacklist helo module allows you to blacklist hosts or
  net blocks (c-class) who use HELO and attempt to identify
  themselves using your own hostname/ip address. This will allow
  you to quickly build up a list of known spammer networks.
  This module is effective because its completely automated
  and can be used to permanently ban networks even if they
  stop identifying themselves with your hostnames at a later
  stage.

  INSERT INTO blacklist_helo (_helo) VALUES ('192.168.0.2');
  INSERT INTO blacklist_helo (_helo) VALUES ('[192.168.0.2]');
  INSERT INTO blacklist_helo (_helo) VALUES ('localhost.machine.com');
  INSERT INTO blacklist_helo (_helo) VALUES ('localhost');
  
  In order for this to work properly. You want to INSERT the
  hostname of your machine, your MX hostname, your MX ip address
  and the IP address of your machine (this includes virtual ips
  that reside on your switch)

  Also if you want to doing wildcard helo blacklisting, you can 
  use the following syntax :

  INSERT INTO blacklist_helo (_helo) VALUES ('192.168.0.%');
  INSERT INTO blacklist_helo (_helo) VALUES ('[192.168.0.%]');
  INSERT INTO blacklist_helo (_helo) VALUES ('localhost.%');

  This can be very usefull for providing several way to helo 
  blacklist without any pain.

  NO REMOTE HOST SHOULD IDENTIFY THEMSELVES WITH YOUR MACHINES
  INFORMATION!



##
# HELO Randomization Prevention (HRP)
########################################

  The HRP module allows you to catch spammers which randomize
  their HELO identities. This can be used in combination with
  greylisting to provide an effective way of cutting spammers
  down before accepting any part of the message.  There are a
  handful of legit  companies which do this,  mainly because
  floating  queues/mtas on different  ip addresses. This  has
  been tested and has been found to be very effective even if
  this module is  used  on its own. (Look at the 'HELO_CHECK'
  portion of policyd.conf)


##
# Policyd Security Notice
###########################

  Policyd  tries to be as strict as possible from a  security
  point of  view. The  maximum  length of  any string  passed
  internally  is limited to 64 characters.  Policyd will also
  ignore any  characters  except "[A-Z][a-z][0-9]/@" and ".".
  Please ensure that any passwords used (in MySQL etc) adhere
  to this  strict rule  and do not exceed  64 characters. All
  strings/ memory are preallocated when Policyd starts up and
  will not use more anymore memory. No memory is free()'d.

###
# Postfix 2.1
###############

  You need Postfix 2.1 or higher in order to use the
  policy service..

  The changes below must be made to main.cf
  
  smtpd_recipient_restrictions =
  ..
    reject_unauth_destination
    reject_unlisted_recipient
    check_policy_service inet:127.0.0.1:10031
  ..

  127.0.0.1 -> host policyd is on
  10031     -> port policyd is listening on

  Please ensure that it matches your policyd.conf settings
  for BINDHOST and BINDPORT.

  If policyd is listening on an IPv6 address you should surround the IPv6 
  address with brackets in main.cf.

    check_policy_service inet:[::1]:10031


###
# MySQL v4/v3
############

  This code has only been tested on MySQL v4.xx (recommended) and v3.xx
  Included is a file called 'DATABASE.mysql' which you can use to create
  all the necessary tables.

  # mysql -p < DATABASE.mysql
  

  Permissions for policyd:
  
  NB!! The information provided below should match that of your Configuration

  Example for 1 host:
  
    GRANT ALL ON policyd.* TO postfix@127.0.0.1 IDENTIFIED by 'p0stf1x';

  Example for a netblock:
 
    GRANT ALL ON policyd.* TO postfix@"192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0" \
    IDENTIFIED by 'p0stf1x';



##
# Whitelist
#############

  Included is a file called 'docs/WHITELIST.sql'. It contains several whitelisted
  hosts to cut down on false positives.

  Import it into mysql by doing:

    mysql policyd < docs/WHITELIST.sql -p 
    

  IP Whitelisting format: 

    INSERT INTO whitelist (_whitelist,_description) \
      VALUES ('127.%.%.%','# localhost');
    INSERT INTO whitelist (_whitelist,_description) \
      VALUES ('192.168.2.10','# lan server');


  Sender Whitelisting format:

    INSERT INTO whitelist_sender (_whitelist,_description) \
      VALUES ('camis@mweb.co.za','# whitelist single address');
    INSERT INTO whitelist_sender (_whitelist,_description) \
      VALUES ('@mweb.co.za','# whitelist entire domain');

    Please note that address whitelist will be matched only against
    the  sender address. For recipient  whitelisting,  please refer
    to the opt-in/opt-out section below.


  DNS name whitelisting

    INSERT INTO whitelist_dnsname (_whitelist,_description) \
      VALUES ('%.mweb.co.za','# whitelist *.mweb.co.za');
    INSERT INTO whitelist_dnsname (_whitelist,_description) \
      VALUES ('%.mail.mud.yahoo.com','# whitelist all yahoo mud mailservers');
    INSERT INTO whitelist_dnsname (_whitelist,_description) \
      VALUES ('n10.bulk.dcn.yahoo.com','# whitelist only this mailserver');

  DNS name whitelisting works as follows:

    [logwall01][/]# host web32804.mail.mud.yahoo.com
      web32804.mail.mud.yahoo.com has address 68.142.206.34
    [logwall01][/]# host 68.142.206.34
      34.206.142.68.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer web32804.mail.mud.yahoo.com.

    The forward and reverse DNS *must* match otherwise it will not work.
    If forward and reverse dns match, then the whitelisting can work.



##
#  Blacklist
##############
    
  Blacklisting format:
    
    INSERT INTO blacklist (_blacklist,_description) \
       VALUES ('222.76.50.%','# spam');
  
  As you can see in the above example, if you want to white or blacklist a
  subnet (whether it is an A B or C class), simply fill % in the other octet(s).


-> Sender Blacklisting format:

    INSERT INTO blacklist_sender (_blacklist,_description) \
      VALUES ('camis@mweb.co.za','# blacklist single address');
    INSERT INTO blacklist_sender (_blacklist,_description) \
      VALUES ('@mweb.co.za','# blacklist entire domain');

  Note: blacklisting @mweb.co.za will *not* blocklist subdomains
        like @subdomain.mweb.co.za.


-> DNS name blacklisting


    INSERT INTO blacklist_dnsname (_blacklist,_description) \
      VALUES ('adsl-%.thisisp.com','# blacklist ADSL users of thisisp.com');
    INSERT INTO blacklist_dnsname (_blacklist,_description) \
      VALUES ('mail.spamtargeting.com','# blacklist only this mailserver');

    The forward and reverse DNS *must* match otherwise it will not work.
    If forward and reverse dns match, then the blacklisting can work.



##
# Recipent ACL's
##################

  Recipient ACL's gives your users and/or domains the power to whitelist
  or blacklist sender email addresses. It allows your users to blacklist
  the whole of hotmail.com but still allow them to recieve mail from
  user123@hotmail.com or visa versa. Examples:

  # block the whole of hotmail.com (priority = 5)
  INSERT INTO rcpt_acl (_sender,_rcpt,_wblist,_priority)
    VALUES ('@hotmail.com','camis@mweb.co.za','b',5);

  # allow user123@hotmail.com (priory = 10)
  INSERT INTO rcpt_acl (_sender,_rcpt,_wblist,_priority)
    VALUES ('user123@hotmail.com','camis@mweb.co.za','w',10);

  A Higher priority ALWAYS takes preference.




##
# Greylist Opt-in / Opt-out
########################################

  Certain accounts / spamtraps / users do not want greylisting.
  Opt-in/out can be enabled in policyd.conf

  _priority is an indication of which entry has the highest preference.

  So for example, if you want only ONE user to be subjected to greylisting
  for the domain mweb.co.za:

  1 == Opt-in
  0 == Opt-out

  INSERT INTO policy (_rcpt,_optin,_priority) VALUES ('@mweb.co.za', 0, 10);
  ^^ above mweb.co.za is by default opted out.

  INSERT INTO policy (_rcpt,_optin,_priority) VALUES ('cami@mweb.co.za', 1, 50);
  ^^ above camis@mweb.co.za has a higher priority therefore will override the
     first rule

  This allows for mixed and matched configurations. So another example, if
  you want everyone for the domain to be subjected to greylisting EXCEPT
  for camis@mweb.co.za:
  
  INSERT INTO policy (_rcpt,_optin,_priority) VALUES ('@mweb.co.za', 1, 10);
  ^^ above mweb.co.za is by default opted in.

  INSERT INTO policy (_rcpt,_optin,_priority) VALUES ('cami@mweb.co.za', 0, 50);
  ^^ above camis@mweb.co.za has a higher priority therefore will override the
     first rule (and thus be opted out)


###
# Greylist training
##################

  When you need to train only specific/new domains for greylisting,
  you can use/enable policy training.

  _rcpt   = email address or domain
  _expire = seconds since epoch

  example:

   INSERT INTO policy_training (_rcpt,_expire) VALUES \
   ('cami@mweb.co.za', UNIX_TIMESTAMP() ); 
   INSERT INTO policy_training (_rcpt,_expire) VALUES \
   ('@mweb.co.za', UNIX_TIMESTAMP() ); 

  Then in policyd.conf, you set TRAINING_POLICY_TIMEOUT to 7d.
  This means that that policy_training entry will expire and
  get cleaned up automatically after 7 days.
